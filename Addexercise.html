        <h4>Creating New Exercise</h4> <br>
        <p id="p"> If you can not find an exercise in our database, you can easily add it yourself. <br>
        For cardio exercises, if you do not know how many calories you burned, instead of creating a new exercise, it's better to enter an existing exercise in our database that is close to the one you performed. This will at least provide you with a rough estimate of how many calories you burned. <br>
        Once you've created an exercise, you will be able to search for it and add it to your exercise log at anyÂ time.</p>
